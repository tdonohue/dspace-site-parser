# find_dspace_sites_via_google.rb
#
# Performs several Google queries to attempt to
# locate DSpace sites out on the web.
#
# Based on the commandline options, you can run
# all queries back to back, or just run individual ones.
# NOTE: If you are too annoying, Google will start throwing 503 errors
# or block you. So, running queries individually is nicer.
#
# RUN VIA:
#   ruby find_dspace_sites_via_google.rb [results-csv-file] [optional-list-of-queries]
#
# For example, this runs just query numbers 1, 2 and 5
#   ruby find_dspace_sites_via_google.rb out.csv 1,2,5
#
